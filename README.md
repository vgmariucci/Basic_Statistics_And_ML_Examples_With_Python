# Basic Statistic and Machine Learning Examples with Python

## Brief Description

This repo has some basic examples of statistics and ML developed using Python for the study objective only.
For more information, I've included a README file in some folders, and in almost all Python scripts I've tried to comment 
all commands and main conclusions of the technique employed.

I hope this will be useful to you.

Thanks.
