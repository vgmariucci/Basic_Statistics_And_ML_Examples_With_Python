# Example 2: Pastry Doughs

A factory produces ready-made dough for pastries. The density of the dough mixture is measured daily
in different machines. Given the following measurements, calculate the mean, median, standard deviation and create the
boxplot graph using python scripts.



# Mixture 1

Density (kg/L):     22.02      23.83     26.67      25.38      25.49      23.50      25.90     24.89

# Mixture 2

Density (kg/L):     21.49      22.67      24.62      24.18      22.78      22.56      24.46     23.79

# Mixture 3

Density (kg/L):     20.33      21.67      24.67      22.45      22.29      21.95      20.49     21.81
