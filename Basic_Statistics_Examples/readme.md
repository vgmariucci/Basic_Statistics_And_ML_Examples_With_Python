# Example 1: Screws from two suppliers

 Suppose you order screws from two suppliers, ten screws from each vendor. The packages of each supplier specifies the length 
 of the screws to be L = 80 mm. To verify which supplier has the screws nearest to the nominal value you decide measure the length
 of each screw from each supplier with the aid of a ruler graded with a millimetric scale and resolution of 1 mm. Once all screws were 
 measured, you organize the data in two tables, one for each supplier, as shown below:



# Supplier A

Length (mm):     81      70      83      72      78      81      81     80      80      79

# Supplier B

 Length (mm)     80      80      80      79      79      78      81      81      80      81

# Questions:

a) How well do the screws fulfil the spec? 

b) Can we compare the two suppliers?

c) Can we infer to the whole supply (population)?
